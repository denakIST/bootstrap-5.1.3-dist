                    My name is Deniz Akar. I’m a marketing analytics leader with over 15 years of experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently I have joined MIT’s FullStack Professional Certificate program to pursue my interest in web development.
                    Throughout my experience I have collaborated with software developers on several projects, and always admired
                    them for having the skills that enable them to take a concept and turn it into a product that people can use. And that, has been a catalyst for me to take the leap to join the program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my prior life, I have gained extensive experience in marketing analytics. I started my professional life in,
                    what is
                    affectionately called “traditional" marketing analytics today which, largely meant statistical predictive
                    modeling,
                    gruesome data collection processes, long lead times and often uninterested recipients of such information.
                    Afterall,
                    marketers regarded marketing mix modeling as a black box that tried to measure the programs they design tell
                    them what they were doing right or wrong. Ironically, fast forward 10-15 years, the proliferation of "Big Data"
                    and
                    M"achine Learning" methods gave “black-box” a new meaning. This left both providers and clients of data and
                    information with
                    a whole set of new challenges to overcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As someone who appreciates the power of taking highly complex and technical topics and communicating them in
                    simple
                    terms, my goal in pursuing fullstack development is to be able to produce products that help make analytics the
                    most
                    important part of every professional’s toolbox. This web site is aimed at tracking the journey with the intent
                    of
                    continuously adding, updating and improving it along the way.
